The Hidden Wiki is a community-run directory that shares links to different sites on the dark web, usually accessed through the Tor network. It’s often compared to Wikipedia because of its simple layout and the way users contribute information. The site covers a wide mix of topics, including privacy, digital rights, and online communities. For many people, the Hidden Wiki works as a starting point for understanding how information and resources are organized within the dark web.
